A daily assistant in the hard work of a programmer

This program helps to combine such services as [Jira](https://atlassian.net), [Toggl](https://toggl.com) and replace most routine activities with one simple CLI utility.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'dude-cli'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install dude-cli

After that create .duderc file in your HOME directory by command:

    $ dude install

And configure all variables in this file 

`PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_TOOL=jira` - Project management (Now only Jira supported)
